    PDF Creator: To transform any document to the PDF format (a new printer is added in your configuration).

Development

    Eclipse: Java development IDE.
    Netbeans: Another Java development IDE, much better as Eclipse when you need to create Java application with Swing (this is my opinion ;o) ).

Multimedia

    XnView: A powerful image viewer. Also offers lot of conversion controls.
