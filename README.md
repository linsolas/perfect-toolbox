perfect-toolbox
===============

The list of tools that I use everyday.

## Purpose

As a developer, and more generally as a computer user, I need to use the adequate tools for my job.
I work on both Windows (for work) and Mac (my personal computer) machines, so I decided to regroup the list of usefull tools for each of these environments.

Do not hesitate to comment or PR if you have any suggestion.


## Notes

When I do not specify any price for an application, it means *normally* that this application is free to use.
An application that requires to buy a licence is marked with the icon ![Buy it](http://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/Sizicons/12x12/dollar.png "Buy it"). This icon is made by [Randomjabber](http://www.randomjabber.com).

My personal favorites applications are marked with ![Lovin it](http://cdn1.iconfinder.com/data/icons/diagona/icon/10/032.png "Lovin it"). This icon is made by [Yusuke Kamiyamane](http://p.yusukekamiyamane.com/).
